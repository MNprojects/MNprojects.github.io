        I built this site from scratch without using any frameworks or templates, using HTML and CSS with JavaScript for any custom applications. 
        <br/>The site will keep expanding as my skills develop.

        iOS Application<br/><br/>
        For my final year project, I created an app for iOS mobile devices using Swift3 and Xcode. It was an educational app, designed to help children learn to spell in English while playing a game. 
        The app mimiced some traditional techniques used for spelling while making use of the touch screen of the device. The user was able to create custom lists of words to test, as well as having some prebuilt
        lists that were suitable for different age groups.
        The game was not released on the App Store.

        Other Websites<br/><br/>
        I created a website using Python with the Django framework. This site is currently not hosted. 
        However, examples of its code and functionality may be found on my GitHub (www.github.com/MNprojects). The functionality simulates a library, where users can
         see the books that the library currently has.
        Users that set themselves as Librarians, are able to change the state of books as being on-loan or available.

        The gaming classic, recreated using JavaScript. It's a rough version that I'm still working on but the core mechanics function.

        <h2>This Website!</h2>
        
        I built this site from scratch without using any frameworks or templates, using HTML and CSS with JavaScript for any custom applications. 
        <br/>The site will keep expanding as my skills develop. <br/><br/>

        <h2>iOS Application</h2>
        For my final year project, I created an app for iOS mobile devices using Swift3 and Xcode. It was an educational app, designed to help children learn to spell in English
        while playing a game. The app mimiced some traditional techniques used for spelling while making use of the touch screen of the device. The user was able to create custom
        lists of words to test, as well as having some prebuilt
        lists that were suitable for different age groups. I made use of Apple's CoreData functionality to store the lists and words. 
        The final product for the the university project lacked any real artwork or animation, making it unsuitable for release on the App Store.

        <h2>Other Websites</h2>
        I created a website using Python with the Django framework. This site is currently not hosted. 
        However, examples of its code and functionality may be found on my GitHub (www.github.com/MNprojects). The functionality simulates a library, where users can
         see the books that the library currently has.
        Users that set themselves as Librarians, are able to change the state of books as being on-loan or available.

        <h2>Pong!</h2>
        The gaming classic, recreated using JavaScript is available on this site. A quick implementation that demonstrates the core mechanics of the game.
        The source code for this can be found on my GitHub page under docs/js/pong.js <br/><br/>

        <h2>Ice Shot!</h2>
        A prototype of a small shooting game. The player is being chased by angry penguins with guns! As you try to move, you find that you slide on the ice
         until you hit a wall whereas the pengiuns will nimbly chase you in ever increasing numbers.<br/><br/>

        The prototype was built using Unity and C#. It was my first experience with either of these and took me about 3 days to create. There are still a lot of improvements to be made on
          this first iteration. The project is hosted on my GitHub page.<br/><br/>
